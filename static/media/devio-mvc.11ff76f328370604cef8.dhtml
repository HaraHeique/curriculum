<p>It is a simple system that consists of product management by suppliers. When a user registers and login into the
    application he will basically register
    suppliers and the products acquired by each supplier.</p>

<p>The main technology used in this project was <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-5.0">ASP.NET MVC Core</a>,
    which consists of using <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio">Razor</a>,
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="https://jquery.com/">Jquery</a> in the front-end and
    <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/getting-started/">C#</a>, <a
        class="link" target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/">EF Core</a>,
    <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio">Identity
        (user management)</a>
    on the back end. Another important point also in this project is the use of <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="https://kisslog.net/"> KissLog</a>
    to carry out issuance and management application logs from external framework.
</p>

<p>Even though it is a small system there are good practices, use of components and dependencies that are very commonly
    applied for
    small/medium size. The entire code was based on the great <a class="link" target="_blank"
        href="https://desenvolvedor.io/dashboard">course</a>
    of the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.eduardopires.net.br/">MVP Eduardo Pires</a>,
    however there were minor changes in the front-end and considerable changes in the back-end made by me with the
    intention of learning mainly in the considerably "new"
    stack from Microsoft which is the .Net Core. Right below there are some images views from the developed app.</p>
