<p>This is a really simple project made in <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a> and
    with the main purpose of learning how to use the basics concepts.</p>

<p>Basically is a game where the user translates a couple of words in english to portuguese (Brazil).
    I made this simple application when I was learning Angular from a course on <a class="link" target="_blank"
